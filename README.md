# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Ensemble-Learning
In this project, I utilized Random Forest for ensemble learning to develop a predictive model for heart failure. Leveraging machine learning techniques, I processed and analyzed relevant medical data to identify patterns associated with heart failure. By employing the Random Forest algorithm, I created an accurate and reliable prediction model capable of effectively assessing the likelihood of heart failure occurrence in patients. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning and data analysis but also highlights my commitment to contributing to advancements in healthcare through innovative technology
